This is the experiment log file to track what I did, what is the problem and what is the result for GRID dataset


Nov 26 2018
What I want:
1. put data into one matrix
2. input the data to FDDLOW to process to see the result
What I did:
I unzipped the GRID file
I plot the length of all the files
	Problem:
	Not all the files are the same length
I found the min length and truncate the files to 27000
	Problem:
	Should I use spectrogram or not


Nov 28 2018
What I want:
1. put data into one matrix
2. prepare two version one is fft+PCA one is just pca
What I did:
I put the calculated PCA per class which is 1000d in to onefile
	problem
	I realized there will be information loss, I cannot use 1000d
I coded to use PCA on the whole dataset
I tried fft of the data, but it was too large. I would to do just pca


Nov 30 2018
What I want:
1. put data into one matrix
2. fix the code to make it run
What I did:
I plot the PCA result
	Problem:
	I did not see clear distinguish between 10 classes
Ignore it, hope to see how classification is
I kept on coding



Dec 3 2018
What I want:
1. train the dictionary to have some preliminary result
What I did:
I fixed all the codes and loading data
	Problem:
	I found there are more trouble than I thought. Testing part is not done
I let it train the dictionary.
I thought if spectrogram is linear transformation.
I guess spectrogram can give me better result, because just PCA is not reasonable to me



Dec 4 2018
What I want:
1. finish the testing code
2. get the data matrix using spectrogram
3. some results for PCA data
What I did:
I visualized the trained dictionary:
	Problem:
	the projection W is just identity matrix not updated.
The Sw-SB+ZZ.T is low rank, I changed code to fit it.
	Problem:
	we were using Sw-SB+ZZ.T, now in the paper we have Sw-SB+ \alpha ZZ.T
I fixed this alpha problem, in loss update Z, W, Lipchiz constant
Retrain the dictionary with updated code



Dec 5 2018
What I want:
1. finish the testing code
2. get the data matrix using spectrogram
3. some results for PCA data
What I did:
I checked the newly trained dictionary
I finished the testing code and got some result of just using PCA with non-mixture
	Problem:
	The pure PCA for this task it is too low, 40% accurace
I will try spectrogram or I need to change dataset.



Dec 6 2018
What I want:
1. get the data matrix result using spectrogram
What I did:
I checked the SVD result of spectrogram data
	Problem:
	It shows all the elements as zeros
I re-run the code to see the result
I modify the loading data to train and test the dictionary
I check the first 3 trained dictionary to plot Loss and Z
